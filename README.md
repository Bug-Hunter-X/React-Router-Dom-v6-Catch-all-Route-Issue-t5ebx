This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using catch-all routes ("* ") in React Router DOM v6.  The problem occurs when the catch-all route is triggered even if a valid route is defined.  This issue is related to how React Router matches routes.  The solution involves carefully considering route ordering and using the correct path matching strategy.  See the provided code samples for the problematic and corrected implementations.
